# B(GT) values for levels below 8 MeV were taken from M. Bhattacharya, et al.,
# Phys. Rev. C 80, 055501 (2009). The values tabulated in that paper were
# multiplied by g_A^2 = (1.26)^2 to account for their differing definition of
# B(GT), which did not include that weak axial-vector coupling constant. The
# value of g_A = 1.26 was implicitly assumed by Bhattacharya, et al. when
# determining the value of the E_0 parameter used to extract the GT strengths
# in their analysis. 40K excitation energies below 8 MeV were assigned using
# known levels tabulated in J. Chen, Nucl. Data Sheets 140, 1 (2017). That
# publication corresponds to the February 2017 revision of ENSDF
# (https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/ensdf/) for A = 40.
#
# B(GT) values for levels above 8 MeV are theoretical estimates from a QRPA
# calculation reported in M. Cheoun, et al., Eur. Phys. J. A 48, 137 (2012) and
# obtained for use with MARLEY via a private communication. The definition of
# B(GT) used in the QRPA calculation did not include the weak axial-vector
# coupling g_A, which was taken to be g_A = 1.23 by the authors when computing
# neutrino cross sections. Therefore, the QRPA B(GT) strengths taken from that
# paper were multiplied by a factor of g_A^2 = (1.23)^2 before being included
# in this file.
#
# The threshold for using theoretical B(GT) values was determined by choosing
# the first level from the QRPA calculation for which the QRPA integrated
# B(GT) strength exceeded the experimental integrated B(GT) strength at the
# highest measured experimental level.
